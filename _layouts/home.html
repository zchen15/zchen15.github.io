I am a curious molecular biologist and a bioinformatics scientist. My work focuses on biodiversity monitoring and developing molecular and bioinformatics tools to make DNA sequencing technologies cheaper, faster, and more accurate. 

I am currently a bioinformatics scientist at <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home.html">Thermo Fisher Scientific</a> and also a clinical instructor for translational genomics at the <a href="https://dtg.usc.edu/site/">Keck School of Medicine at USC</a>. Previously, I was the bioinformatics lead of <a href="https://www.sequentialskin.com/aboutus">Sequential Skin</a>. In my academic life, I was a Principal Investigator for the <a href="https://bbaloglu.github.io/research/understanding-climate-change.html">Monitoring Climate Change In The Sub-Arctic</a> project, funded by the Northern Research Fund. I also was a postdoctoral researcher for the <a href="https://bbaloglu.github.io/research/improving-Metabarcoding.html">Optimizing Workflows For Freshwater Metabarcoding</a>, <a href="https://bbaloglu.github.io/research/GreatLakesEPA.html">Biodiversity Monitoring In The Great Lakes</a>, and <a href="https://bbaloglu.github.io/research/ashure.html">Metabarcoding With Nanopore Sequencing</a> projects, funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, US EPA, Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, and University of Guelph grants. 

I earned my Ph.D. from <a href="http://www.dbs.nus.edu.sg/">Department of Biological Sciences</a> at the National University of Singapore, where I was advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6qF7vGkAAAAJ&hl=en">Rudolf Meier</a>. My doctoral research has been funded by TEV-SINGA (Singapore International Graduate Award), Singapore's National Water Agency (PUB), Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI), and National University of Singapore (NUS). 
I got my B.Sc. degree in Molecular Biology and Genetics from <a href="http://www.global.itu.edu.tr/">Istanbul Technical University</a>. I also completed exchange studies for two semesters at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich</a>.

I am passionate about aquatic research, DNA sequencing technologies, and bioinformatics research. I also had opportunities to do field work in the tropics as well as sub-arctic Canada, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Outside of science, I love writing, communicating science, <a href="https://github.com/BBaloglu/SDS_Biyoenformatik">teaching Python & bioinformatics</a>, travelling, and climbing.
