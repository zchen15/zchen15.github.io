I was invited by the amazing Women in Molecular Biology (WIMB) team at the University of Southern California as a panelist to share my insights on how to transition to industry, what are the non-academic track options for molecular biologists, and what are (according to me) the best practices to be successful in biotech world. 

Always happy to help those who realize academia is not the only option and want to pursue alternative careers. Thank you so much WIMB for the invite!
