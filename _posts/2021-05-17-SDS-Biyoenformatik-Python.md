I am mentoring a community of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from Turkey and I started teaching them Bioinformatics with Python. We just wrapped up our third lecture, and it is going pretty well so far. 

Take a look at the Jupyter notebooks and the rest of the course material on my Github page [SDS/Biyoenformatik](https://github.com/BBaloglu/SDS_Biyoenformatik).
