I defended about a month ago and finally got awarded my Ph.D. degree. It has been a wild journey but I am so happy to be where I am now.

My PhD thesis is on the bioassessment and monitoring of Singapore's aquatic environments using Next Generation sequencing. It comprises of three main chapters looking into: 
1. Characterizing an insect outbreak that has economic and ecological implications for Singaporean society, 
2. A Nanopore MinION based DNA barcoding workflow for quick and cheap barcoding in the field, and 
3. Characterizing a species-rich tropical swamp forest with DNA barcoding, which led to discovery of ~350 new insect species. 

You can find my thesis below. I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to your feedback on it.
