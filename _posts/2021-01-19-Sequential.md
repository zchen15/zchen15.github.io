I am very grateful for the opportunity to work with the brilliant team at Sequential Skin, where I will be contributing to research in skin microbiome analysis.

[Sequential Skin](https://www.sequentialskin.com/) is all about skin! The novel Sequential Skin Test the team so far developed assesses your genetic predisposition to certain traits and how your skin microbiome and present environment influences them. The results from the test provides a better idea about the current state of your skin. I will be working on making the sample-to-results process faster and more informative. 

Super excited!
