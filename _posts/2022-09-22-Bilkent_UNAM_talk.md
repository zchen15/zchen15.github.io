I gave a seminar entitled as "Next Generation Biomonitoring: Implementing Machine Learning for Accurate Metabarcoding with Nanopore MinION" at the prestigious Bilkent University National Nanotechnology Research Center (Bilkent UNAM) and answered questions from the brilliant students and academics. 

It was my first time giving a talk at UNAM, and it felt great to learn about the projects there and the spin-off companies spearheaded by Dr. Urartu Seker. I look forward to collaborating on projects related to nanopore sequencing with Seker lab.
