I gave a talk on metabarcoding with Nanopore sequencing at the 8th International Barcode of Life Conference (iBOL 2019) in Trondheim, Norway. It was a great conference with 450 participants from 61 nations. I had an amazing time and on top of it, with my talk, I won the 'AllGenetics award for industrial applications using DNA barcoding and DNA metabarcoding for environmental DNA study. Thanks AllGenetics for recognizing my work and emphasizing its value for industry-oriented research!
