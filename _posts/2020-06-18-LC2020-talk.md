I presented a poster at the London Calling 2020 organized by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. 
It was a strange experience with the conference being virtual yet there was still enough room for interacting with people and 
various research projects ranging from agri-genomics to sars-cov2 genome sequencing to food research. 
You can find my poster on the use of nanopore sequencing for metabarcoding below.
