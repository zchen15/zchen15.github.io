I am in New York City to help with the molecular workflow optimization for Nanopore sequencing as part of my work with [Sequential Skin](https://www.sequentialskin.com/). The lab is located at the Weiss Building at Rockefeller University, and provided by IndieBio New York. It is a great opportunity to live and work in this beautiful and hectic city.

Fingers crossed on the experiments!
