I am super excited to start working as the Clinical Instructor of Translational Genomics at the Department of Translational Genomics, Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. Now, that is a mouthful! 

At USC, I will be a part time lecture faculty and help develop content, teach, and provide support for the Masters Translational Biomedical Informatics and bioinformatics. I gotta say, I am terrified and excited at the same time.

I can't wait to start this new position and learn from the talented people at the Translational Genomics department!
