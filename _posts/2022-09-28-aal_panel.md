I was invited by my high school teacher, Fatma Kurt, to meet the senior year students at Antalya Anadolu Lisesi (2nd best in Antalya in terms of ranking). Within the Turkish education system, the only way to enter a university is through the nationwide Higher Education Institutions Exam (YKS). With more than 2,5 million students taking this exam every year, this high school had students in Turkey's top 10.
In the panel, I shared insights about (my) academic and industry career, and answered a wide range of questions, such as studying abroad, gene editing, machine learning, species discovery in Singapore's swamp forest, what bioinformatics is, and my experiences living in multiple countries.

Really happy to share my knowledge with these brilliant students and wish them all the best in their studies.
