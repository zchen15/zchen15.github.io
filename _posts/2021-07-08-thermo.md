I am happy to join Thermo and to be able to work from LA, with occasional travel in the Southwestern US as their bioinformatics scientist. 

I also really enjoyed being a part of Sequential Skin as their bioinformatics lead in the last 6 months, with two months being in NYC as part of IndieBio and SOSV. I will continue working with Sequential as their bioinformatics consultant.

Excited about this new opportunity and very happy to be going back to LA!
