I am very grateful for the opportunity to give a TEDx talk in my home country! If COVID-19 allows, it will be happening in October, 
but who knows if that will be the case!? I will post the details here.

This year's theme is 'First Step'. I am planning to talk about 'How insects will save the world' with examples from my research in 
Singapore and Canada on portable DNA sequencing, bioassessment, and aquatic ecosystems. It will be the first step for most people 
into the diverse life of insects as well as the pocket-sized DNA sequencing.

Many thanks to [Istanbul Kültür Üniversitesi](https://www.iku.edu.tr/) and the organizers for the invite, I am honored!
